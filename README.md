Customer Churn Prediction Using AI:
This repository focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of customer records, providing insights into features that influence customer retention.

Project Overview:

The goal is to build and compare the performance of several machine learning models for predicting customer churn. 
The following algorithms are used:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Dataset
The dataset includes information such as customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns, which help in predicting if a customer is likely to churn.

Project Development

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled features for optimal model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data patterns and correlations to understand feature importance.
Model Implementation: Trained multiple models to predict churn using preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with visualization through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Results

Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of X%.
Decision Tree: Achieved an accuracy of Y%.
Random Forest: Achieved an accuracy of Z%.
SVM: Achieved an accuracy of W%.
KNN: Achieved an accuracy of V%.
Performance metrics and visualizations help to compare model effectiveness.
